title: "Margins, Mapping and Multi-plotting"
output: html_document
---

This document is a self-paced tutorial through some of the plotting tools provided in a base R installation. First, we'll cover how to handle margins, setting and controlling axes and other graphical parameters. Then we'll move onto including maps in base R plots, and finally we'll use a range of functions (from simple to complex) to design multi-plot figures.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
